Subject: Re: Overview of functionality for current and Internet CLRA
signups

Rick,
Gary has commented on existing system so won't repeat.
Sign-up sheets are posted more typically a week in advance rather than a
month.
Statements are emailed only to those with email addresses otherwise
statements are sent via US mail.


Internet system - 
1. Sign ups should be restricted to approved members and names supplied
from approved list. Such a pick list would also avoid spelling problems
etc.
2. Once form taken down (locked) not sure needs to be visiable to users.
Not sure need for coach to add name to form since to final format is the
boating sheet that the coach makes up and session manager administers.

Good luck on your pursuit of this project.
Roger
