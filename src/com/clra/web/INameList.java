/**
 * Declares JSP attributes and bean properties for alphabetized lists of
 * stuff. Views that implement this interface may be controlled via components
 * such as NameSelector.<p>
 *
 * For Java Server Pages, this interface declares three attributes that should
 * be set and accessed within the scope of a request or session:<ul>
 * <li><strong>restricted</strong>: is the view restricted to a range of
 * items with names that start with a particular group of letters?
 * [true,false]</li>
 * <li><strong>group</strong>: if the view is restricted, the group of letters
 * with the name of an item should begin.
 * <li><strong>comparator</strong>: specifies a bean that implements
 * <tt>java.util.Comparator</tt> which can compare instances of
 * INamed. The current implementation of NameSelector does not
 * use the value of this attribute.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The Integer value specified by <tt>group</tt> refers to predefined
 * groups:<ol>
 * <li> ABC  - names less than 'D'</li>
 * <li> DEF  - names between 'D' and 'F'</li>
 * <li> GHI  - names between 'G' and 'I'</li>
 * <li> JKL  - names between 'J' and 'L'</li>
 * <li> MNO  - names between 'M' and 'O'</li>
 * <li> PQRS - names between 'P' and 'S'</li>
 * <li> TUV  - names between 'T' and 'V'</li>
 * <li> WXYZ - names greater than or equal to 'W'</li>
 * </ol>
 * Note that the first group, <tt>ABC</tt>, may contain names like "3Com",
 * whereas the last group, <tt>WXYZ</tt>, may contain names like "Ã‹tvos".
 * Also note that the group index is indexed from '1', not '0'.</p>
 *
 * For beans, this interface declares five properties:<ul>
 * <li><strong>restricted</strong>: read/write Boolean</li>
 * <li><strong>group</strong>: read/write Integer</li>
 * <li><strong>comparator</strong>: read/write java.util.Comparator, compares
 * instances of INamed</li>
 * <li><strong>iterator</strong>: read-only iterator of INamed
 * instances</li>
 * </ul>
